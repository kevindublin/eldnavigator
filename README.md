## Readme

I was sick of opening the State's PDF while in my program at [Alder Graduate School of Education](https://aldergse.edu/academic-programs/masters-credential-teacher-residency/), so I asked Gemini to extract the data from the PDF to create a JSON of the standards. I started to build a PWA and use the [Modulo.JS Framework](https://modulojs.org/), but then I realized that I was procastinating and avoiding my project. So then I decided to articulate what I wanted and try vibe coding. This v1 prototype is the result. I'll likely add a Google Form or my email to solicit what else to add / how it might be useful. I have some ideas:

- Links to videos of lessons demonstrating or explaining each.
- Links to articles and chapters about ELD
- Curriculum for each grade

- - -
